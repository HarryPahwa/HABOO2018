Team HABOO, which stands for High Altitude Balloon Ozone Observer is an inter-disciplinary and even inter-institutional team, made up of Stephanie Schneider, a 1st year Masters student in Environmental Chemistry student at the University of Toronto, Sherry Gao, a third year Engineering Physics student, Evans Frandsen, a second year Mechanical Engineering student and Nigel Rodrigues, Harry Singh, Rahul Ravin, and Jean-Luc Olsen, are all in their fifth year of Mechanical Engineering. The team’s faculty adviser is, Dr. Aleksey Baldygin, Research Scientist in MecE’s iSSELab, KRÜSS Surface Science hub and Dr. Prashant Waghmare, Assistant Professor in Mechanical Engineering is the principal investigator.

Rahul Ravin initiated the formation of the team, having learned about the balloon project when he attended a SEDS-Canada conference. When the competition was announced he reached out to fellow undergraduates and Dr. Baldygin and they worked together on the proposal. “I wanted to be part of the CSA program to launch a balloon 35 kilometers into the atmosphere. I like the challenge of designing something for the extreme conditions of near-space,” says Ravin.

The group decided to test an idea from the literature that has not been verified to date. “Several researchers working within the solar geoengineering research program at Harvard have proposed to use calcite aerosol instead of sulphate aerosol into the stratosphere to scatter the sun’s rays as a solution to global warming,” explains Ravin. “Sulphate aerosols are the leading choice for solar geoengineering, however they are found to degrade the local concentrations of ozone. It is theorized that calcite would not have this detrimental effect, and therefore could be a better option for geoengineering.”

The HABOO team designed an experiment to expose small amounts of calcite in the stratosphere. The calcite samples will be exposed and the team will analyze the reaction products to determine whether the calcite could have an impact on local ozone concentrations. Samples will be exposed for various amounts of time.

“Calcite is fairly stable and it’s found in the environment naturally,” says Ravin. “There are models in the literature which suggest that it could lead to an increase in local ozone concentrations. We do not expect any ozone break down. But we’re going to verify the models.”
